<ul>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/EAkeweje/GPmix">GPmix </a>: GPmix (Gaussian Process mixture) is for learning mixtures of Gaussian processes. It is built on the property that the projection coefficients of the functional data onto any given projection function follow a univariate Gaussian mixture model.  </li>
	<li><a href="...">FAE </a>: ...  </li>
</ul>
