# Software

Here is a list of Python packages for functional data clustering developed by my team and me. In addition to the package documentation, you can find tutorials on the underlying methodology <a href="https://www.scss.tcd.ie/mimi.zhang/Tutorial.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/EAkeweje/GPmix" target="_blank">GPmix</a>: GPmix is for the cluster analysis of one-dimensional functional data. The main idea is to project the functions onto a randomly generated projection function, and apply GMM on the projection coefficients for (parametric) cluster analysis. </li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/samuelveersingh/FAE" target="_blank">FAEclust</a>: FAEclust is for the cluster analysis of multi-dimensional functional data. It is capable of capturing complex relationships among component random functions and can handle functional data in both linear spaces and Riemannian manifolds </li>
</ul>
