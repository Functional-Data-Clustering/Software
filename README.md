# Software

Here is a list of Python packages for functional data clustering developed by my team and me. In addition to the package documentation, you can find tutorials on the underlying methodology <a href="https://www.scss.tcd.ie/mimi.zhang/Tutorial.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/EAkeweje/GPmix" target="_blank">GPmix</a>: GPmix (Gaussian Process mixture) is for learning mixtures of Gaussian processes. It is built on the property that the projection coefficients of the functional data onto any given projection function follow a univariate Gaussian mixture model.  </li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/samuelveersingh/FAE" target="_blank">FAEclust</a>: FAEclust is for the cluster analysis of multi-dimensional functional data. It is capable of capturing complex relationships among component random functions and can handle functional data in both linear spaces and Riemannian manifolds </li>
</ul>
