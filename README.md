Here is a list of Python packages for functional data clustering that my team and I have developed:
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/EAkeweje/GPmix">GPmix </a>: GPmix (Gaussian Process mixture) is for learning mixtures of Gaussian processes. It is built on the property that the projection coefficients of the functional data onto any given projection function follow a univariate Gaussian mixture model.  </li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/samuelveersingh/FAE">FAEclust </a>: FAEclust is for the cluster analysis of multi-dimensional functional data. It is capable of capturing complex relationships among component random functions and can handle functional data in both linear spaces and Riemannian manifolds </li>
</ul>
